# The Canvas Method
A simple reflection framework for noticing the outlines already in place that are shaping my life, using the metaphor of painting.

## Purpose
Create the feeling of being the artist of my masterpiece — me.

## Canvas Areas
### The Past
- Most of the paint has dried
- Some parts of the painting made things possible or kept me safe
- Some parts were painful, harmful, or unsafe
- Aging and new experiences can repaint how I see the past

### The Future
- The canvas isn’t blank
  - Shapeless dark areas represent my fears
  - Penciled sketches are scattered throughout — some prominent, some nearly invisible

- The brush is in my hands, however…
  - Some sketches were drawn by others
  - Some sketches were drawn by me
  - Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference
  - Sometimes I’m painting by numbers
 
## Working With the Canvas
- I can paint over a sketch
- I can emphasize it
- I can leave it as-is
- I can simply understand it better
- I can repaint the past without changing it (memory is interpretive)
